SUMMARY="Native, modular software synthesizer"
DESCRIPTION="Sync modular is a modular synthesizer allowing you to build your own synthesizer and \
sounds. In 2010, Sync modular became a freeware. You can use this name and serial number \
to register the application:

User name : Free registration
Serial number : eCDiPa-kbbmPZ-zGDJuyU

You can download instruments and macros created by users from SyncModular's website.

Here we are going to list the most important features of SynC Modular.

* SynC Modular is modular. This means that it has no fixed structure. Instead it allows \
you to create your own synth structures, as well as using the synth structures created \
by others. Ideally you can simulate any synthesizer with its modular features. In \
practice, though, there are always limits to all vanilla promises.

* SynC Modular is multitimbral. You can have as many as 16 different synths playing \
at the same time within SynC Modular. Besides that you can change any of those \
synths for another one on the fly, by means of MIDI program change. The limit to this \
vanilla promise is your CPU performance which sets the top margin on the overall \
complexity of the synths.

* SynC Modular is fast. With its unique modular optimization technology it offers you \
the performance of a non-modular software synth.

* SynC Modular is flexible. When going down the module structure it allows you as deep \
as creating your own oscillators and filters! The Sawtooth oscillator, the Sine oscillator, \
the 1- and 2-pole filters and many more modules are not the basic pieces. You can dig \
further into their internal structure. This promise is limited by the fact that you better \
know the DSP theory if you are willing to design your own filters, rather than combining \
the existing ones. But hey, you could use filters created by someone else, coudn't you?"
